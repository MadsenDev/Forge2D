## What is Forge2D?

Forge2D is a 2D game framework built with Rust, winit, and wgpu. It provides the core systems needed to build 2D games: rendering, physics, pathfinding, and content pipelines. The focus is on **coherence over completeness**—making the existing systems work well together rather than adding every possible feature.

### Key Features

- ✅ Cross-platform window management
- ✅ Frame-accurate input system
- ✅ Hardware-accelerated 2D rendering
- ✅ Efficient batched sprite rendering (up to 2048 sprites per frame)
- ✅ Text rendering with TTF/OTF fonts
- ✅ 2D camera system with follow behavior and dead-zones
- ✅ Asset caching
- ✅ Audio support
- ✅ Fixed timestep for deterministic physics
- ✅ 2D physics engine (Rapier2D integration)
- ✅ General-purpose grid system for tile-based games
- ✅ A* pathfinding algorithm
- ✅ Built-in entity components
- ✅ Scene serialization (save/load)
- ✅ HUD layer for screen-space UI

### What Forge2D Intentionally Doesn't Do

These are **design decisions**, not oversights:

- ❌ **No advanced UI framework** - HUD primitives (text, sprites, rects) only. No layout system, widgets, or input routing. For complex UI, use a library like `egui` or build custom.
- ❌ **No debug tools** - No in-engine debug drawing, gizmos, entity inspector, or console overlay. You'll debug with `println!` and external tools.
- ❌ **No asset pipeline** - No texture atlasing, compression, or hot-reload. Load assets at runtime from files/bytes.
- ❌ **No full ECS framework** - Lightweight `World`/`EntityId` system only. No archetypes, parallel iteration, or complex queries. For advanced ECS, integrate `hecs` or `bevy_ecs`.
- ❌ **No export/packaging tools** - No built-in way to package games for distribution. Use `cargo` and platform-specific tools.

### What Forge2D Doesn't Have Yet (But Could Add)

These are **not yet implemented**, but would be added if a reference game forces them:

- ⚠️ **Animation system** - No sprite sheets, tweens, or animation graphs yet. You can implement basic animation using delta time and sprite swapping, or use a library. A minimal animation system would be added if a platformer or action game requires it.

### What Forge2D Guarantees

These are promises you can rely on:

- ✅ **Deterministic physics** - Fixed timestep ensures physics is reproducible across runs (given same inputs)
- ✅ **Stable serialization** - Scene save/load format is versioned and backward-compatible within major versions
- ✅ **Consistent coordinate system** - Camera position represents center of view; all coordinate conversions are consistent
- ✅ **Thread-safe events** - Physics events use channels and are safe to handle across threads
- ✅ **No hidden allocations in hot paths** - Rendering and physics updates avoid allocations during gameplay

### Current Gaps (Known Limitations)

These are areas that may need attention depending on your game:

- ⚠️ **Animation** - No built-in animation system yet. You can implement basic animation using delta time and sprite swapping. A minimal animation system (sprite sheets, simple tweens) would be added if a reference game requires it.
- ⚠️ **Advanced UI** - Complex menus/interfaces require custom code or external UI library
- ⚠️ **Debug tooling** - No visual debugging tools; rely on logging and external profilers
- ⚠️ **ECS ergonomics** - Component queries are simple; complex systems may need better iteration patterns
- ⚠️ **Asset management** - No texture atlasing or compression; large asset counts may need optimization

### Requirements

- **Rust**: 2021 edition or later
- **GPU**: Graphics drivers installed (wgpu requirement)
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Philosophy: Coherence Over Completeness

Forge2D prioritizes making existing systems work well together over adding every possible feature. The engine is designed to be **extended** rather than **complete**.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Pick a **reference game** (platformer, top-down, tile-based, etc.)
2. Build it using Forge2D's existing systems
3. Add only what that game **forces** you to add
4. If you can build the same game twice faster the second time, the engine is winning

This keeps Forge2D focused and prevents it from becoming a "forever project" that supports everything but feels awkward to use.
